#I had no end of trouble trying to find out how to do this.
#Finally found the answer at
#https://scotch.io/@denisddesigner/clone-and-edit-github-repo-using-aws-cloud-9
#from Denis Murphy who deserves all the credit.
#I'm merely posting this to help other frustrated
#students and rookie developers like me and practice
#setting up a repo.
#Use the code below in your AWS Cloud9 terminal
#being sure to be in the directory of the pertinent app
# for example: ubuntu@ip-172-31-82-63:~/rails_projects/alpha-blog$


git init
git add .
git commit -m "description of what I changed"
git push origin master

#you will also need to generate SSH keys in AWS Cloud9
#to do this.
#I doesn't have any SSH keys like the old Cloud9.
#plenty of help here:
